# Getting started
This wiki covers a variety of Tezos topics ranging from "Baking" to "Governance" to "Smart Contracts". It also includes practical Tezos resources like wallets and block explorers.

To get started with Tezos developer documentation, [**see here**](http://tezos.gitlab.io/) or the [Tezos.com developer portal](https://developers.tezos.com)

For those with technical questions about Tezos, check out the [**Tezos Stack Exchange**](https://tezos.stackexchange.com/).
