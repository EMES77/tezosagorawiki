# Welcome to the Tezos Agora Wiki!

The Tezos Agora Wiki is a place to get started and learn about Tezos. It also aims to answer the frequently asked questions about the Tezos protocol & the Tezos ecosystem.

## Getting started

The wiki is separated into five sections:

* The welcome section includes this page, the white paper and position paper.
* Learn - A general knowledgebase of Tezos for anyone and everyone. 
* Build - Is more for developers, project leaders and those wishing to build and develop on Tezos. 
* User - Contains information and resources for users and those wishing to put Tezos into practice.
* Contribute - Has more resources for assisting with this page. 

To get started with Tezos developer documentation, [**see here**](http://tezos.gitlab.io/) or the [Tezos.com developer portal](https://developers.tezos.com)

For those with technical questions about Tezos, check out the [**Tezos Stack Exchange**](https://tezos.stackexchange.com/).
