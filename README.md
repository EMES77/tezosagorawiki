# Welcome to the TQ Tezos Wiki!

This is a one-stop-shop to get started learning about Tezos and to answer the frequently asked questions about the Tezos protocol & the Tezos ecosystem.

This wiki aspires to be a living document that will evolve as the Tezos protocol evolves. If interested in proposing a change to this document, feel free to submit an issue or make a merge request to [this Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/tqgroup/tezos-wiki/tree/master/files).
