# Welcome to the TQ Tezos Wiki!

The TQ Tezos Wiki is a place to get started and learn about Tezos. It also aims to answer the frequently asked questions about the Tezos protocol & the Tezos ecosystem.

This wiki aspires to be a living document that will evolve as the Tezos protocol (and ecosystem) evolves. If interested in proposing a change to this document, please feel free to submit an issue or make a merge request to [this Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/tqgroup/tezos-wiki/tree/master/files).

# Getting started
