# Tezos Projects {#projects}

## Tokenization

### BTG Pactual
In May 2020, [BTG Pactual](https://www.btgpactual.com/)—Latin America’s largest standalone investment bank—formally announced the launch of ReitBZ, a USD ~1B REIT offered as natively digital (tokenized) securities on the Tezos blockchain. This real-estate backed token issuance marked the beginning of BTG’s commitment to utilize Tezos for all of its future digital securities offerings—a pivot from its previous Ethereum-based strategy.

### Elevated Returns
[Elevated Returns](https://www.elevatedreturns.com/)—the digital asset management company responsible for tokenizing the St. Regis Resort in Aspen, Colorado—selected Tezos as the default blockchain for its real-estate backed digital securities offerings. Elevated Returns began its transition onto Tezos with the migration of AspenCoin in February 2019. The company has since launched its own digital securities exchange, on which it is expected to offer over $1B in tokenized real estate assets on Tezos. 

### Inveniam
[Inveniam](https://inveniam.io/) is a data integrity platform for private markets that facilitates price discovery and liquidity for private equity and commercial real estate assets. Inveniam uses the Tezos blockchain as the backbone of its data integrity offering.

### Vertalo

Also a regulated digital transfer agent, Vertalo has since announced over ~$200M in digital securities offerings from 20 different companies, all of which will be launched on Tezos.
