## Tokenization

### BTG Pactual

### Elevated Returns
[Elevated Returns](https://www.elevatedreturns.com/)—the digital asset management company responsible for tokenizing the St. Regis Resort in Aspen, Colorado—selected Tezos as the default blockchain for its real-estate backed digital securities offerings. Elevated Returns began its transition onto Tezos with the migration of AspenCoin in February 2019. The company has since launched its own digital securities exchange, on which it is expected to offer over $1B in tokenized real estate assets on Tezos.
