## Tokenization

### BTG Pactual
In May 2020, [BTG Pactual](https://www.btgpactual.com/)—Latin America’s largest standalone investment bank—formally announced the launch of ReitBZ, a USD ~1B REIT offered as natively digital (tokenized) securities on the Tezos blockchain. This real-estate backed token issuance marked the beginning of BTG’s commitment to utilize Tezos for all of its future digital securities offerings—a pivot from its previous Ethereum-based strategy.
