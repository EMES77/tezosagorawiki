# Blockchain Indexers

### What is an indexer?

A block explorer is typically made of:

* an indexer that extracts the on-chain data and stores it into a database
* an API that queries the database
* a frontend that displays the data

So, the indexer is the part of the explorer that fetches the raw data from the node, then processes it and stores it in the database in an efficient way to provide quick access to the blockchain data.
