# TzKT

We have talked about how a blockchain includes a lot of transactions and information. Working directly on the whole blockchain to fetch and process data will be time consuming. The **TzKT indexer** can reduce this time and in addition, offers high-level [functionalities](https://github.com/baking-bad/tzkt#features), which are not provided by the Tezos JSON/RPC interface.

You can [install](https://github.com/baking-bad/tzkt#installation-docker) or [build](https://github.com/baking-bad/tzkt#installation-from-source) it, and [configure](https://github.com/baking-bad/tzkt#install-tzkt-indexer-and-api-for-testnets) it for the testnet.

At this point, we want to learn how to work with the **TzKT API**. Therefore, we will work with a [public endpoint](https://api.tzkt.io/#section/Introduction).
