# Block Explorers

Block explorers are an important set of tools for the ecosystem as a whole. They provide an easy-to-use interface for any stakeholder to check on the state of the blockchain in real-time. This means that users can go to a block explorer and get full insight into whether their transaction has been processed by searching for it with the hash of their transaction.

Similarly, on Tezos, there are numerous block explorers that allow you to have full visibility into the state of the blockchain. Youâ€™re able to see metrics that pertain to the recent blocks, the staking activity, price, transaction volume, supply, and many more.

Here are some commonly used Tezos block explorers:

1. [TzStats](https://tzstats.com/)
2. [tezblock](https://tezblock.io/)
3. [TzKT](https://tzkt.io/)
4. [TezTracker](https://teztracker.com/en/mainnet/)
