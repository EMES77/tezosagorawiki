# Proof-of-Stake

Participants \(“nodes”\) in decentralized, peer-to-peer networks provide the necessary computational resources that keep a network up and running. Proof-of-Stake \(PoS\) is the mechanism by which the various participants in Tezos reach consensus on the state of the blockchain. Unlike other PoS protocols, any stakeholder can participate in the consensus process in Tezos and be rewarded by the protocol itself for contributing to the security and stability of the network. Additionally, PoS is less costly than other consensus mechanisms and lowers the barriers to entry for involvement.
