# Baking

“Baking” is the act of signing and publishing blocks to the Tezos blockchain. Bakers are a crucial component of the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism by ensuring that all transactions in a block are correct, that the order of transactions is agreed upon, and that no double-spending has occurred.



## What is baking? <a id="what"></a>

Baking is how blocks are produced and validated on the Tezos blockchain. To bake blocks, a baker needs to participate in Proof-of-Stake, which requires a minimum of 8,000 XTZ \(1 roll\). The more rolls of tez that a baker owns, the higher your chances are at baking blocks and earning baking rewards.
