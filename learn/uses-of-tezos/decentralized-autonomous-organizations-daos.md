# Decentralized Autonomous Organizations \(DAOs\)

## Introduction to DAOs

## DAOs

A decentralized autonomous organization is a collective of individuals or organizations governing resources, registries, or rules. These types of organizations avoid problems typically faced by traditional hierarchies through increased transparency and automated execution. DAO decision-making can be leveraged for something as simple as transferring funds to an individual account or organization, to the execution of code and updating a DAO with an entirely new set of rules. Decisions that are made by a DAO are transparent, with activity and voting being reflected on-chain to avoid any pitfalls of closed-door decision-making. Upgrades and proposals in DAOs are typically automatically executed once a proposal reaches a required quorum, reflecting both a DAOs ability to be agile and efficient.

## Standards and Resources

* [BaseDAO](https://github.com/tqtezos/baseDAO) - a smart contract framework enabling anyone to create a DAO on Tezos for the decentralized governance of resources, registries, or rules.
* [Homebase](https://tqtezos.medium.com/daos-on-tezos-announcing-homebase-80bbecbb9bfe) - a user interface for DAOs, built to empower developers and communities to launch and participate in Tezos-based DAOs.

## DAO Examples

* **Public Goods Funding** - Public goods are any collective resource that we use \(for blockchains, this could be infrastructure and tooling\) that typically suffer from the [free-rider problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem). In order to prevent the underfunding of public goods that are typically relied upon for critical infrastructure, a DAO can be established by a group of actors and projects in a particular ecosystem to direct a treasury of donations towards funding the development and maintenance of public goods.
* **Protocol DAO** - Decentralized protocols typically have a number of parameters that need to continually be modified to ensure the safety of a system. For this, let's use the example of a decentralized lending protocol. Parameters that are typically modified in a decentralized lending protocol include collateralization rates which ensure the safety of loans during times of high market volatility or even types of assets supported for lending. A DAO consisting of token holders incentivized to keep this decentralized system operational can continually propose changes and vote on these parameters.
