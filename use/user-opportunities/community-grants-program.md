# Community Grants Program

The Community Rewards Program allows anyone in the Tezos community to be recognized and rewarded for their efforts. The CRP is managed by [Tezos Commons](https://tezoscommons.org/rewards/).  
  
Numerous factors are used when evaluating submissions such as, quality of submissions, quality of activity, number of submissions, and verifiable proof of activity done by the nominee \(no single factor is determinative of a winner, as all factors were weighed to select winners\). The judges would like to note that for each category, they are looking for the respective monthly related activity meaning submissions should reflect activities done for that current month, i.e.; month of February activities \(this applies to all categories except the OG category\).

## How to nominate yourself or another

## How best to provide proof and help your nominate win

We’re seeing more and more submissions that don’t qualify or are not as helpful as they could be. We know you want your favorite community contributor to get the recognition they deserve some reminders and  ways to help:  
  


* **Only  submissions for work done in the particular month of the CRP are eligible**. If it is currently June and you present a submission for May then that submission will not help. 



* **Provide as great of a case and as much proof as possible** to help your nomination receive a reward. If it’s in telegram, discord or another platform you can share the date and time of what you saw along with a screenshot.



* **Ways to provide proof**

  * Share a link directly to the work on a live website or app. If the work is deleted by the time of review then it does not qualify. 
  * Share the time and platform of the work. If the particular app does not allow for direct links to messages then share the time and day of the interaction for direct review. 
  * Bonus points if you take a screenshot of the work, and share it on Twitter with an @tezoscommons tag.

* **A friendly reminder**, trying to game the system will result in disqualification, this will be determined by the judges discretion.

  
**Need help?** If you are not sure, please reach out in the [telegram](https://t.me/tezosplatform) or [discord](https://discord.gg/5v5QVKjvc2) and we will happily help. 

## The Reward Categories
