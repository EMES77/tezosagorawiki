Baking is how blocks are produced and validated on the Tezos blockchain. To bake blocks, you need to take part in [Tezos Proof-of-stake system](https://github.com/tezosagorawiki/wiki/tree/4162112ca54924d26b4ad20ba5c009e8e75f87c2/files/baking/proofofstake.md#consensus), which requires a minimum of 8,000 XTZ \(1 roll\). The more XTZ you own, the higher your chances are at baking blocks and earning baking rewards.
